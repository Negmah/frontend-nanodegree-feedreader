### Summary
***
Build all required test suites and ensure they validate, on a ready-built app.

### Goal
***
This project aims to test each student's ability to implement TTD (Test Driven Development) using Jasmine and JavaScript (vanilla and/or jQuery) by following some guidelines.
_Test-driven development_ is "Red, Green, Refactor." Red: Create a test and make it fail. Green: Make the test pass by any means necessary. Refactor: Change the code to remove duplication in your project and to improve the design while ensuring that all tests still pass.

#### Project specifications
